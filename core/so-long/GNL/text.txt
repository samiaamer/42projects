### **Computer Security Definition**

- Protection of automated information systems to maintain:
    - **Confidentiality**
    - **Integrity**
    - **Availability**

---

### **CIA Triad**

1. **Confidentiality**
    - Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access.
        - **Privacy**: Controls who can collect and share personal information.
        - it’s done through:
            - cryptography: computer —> Encryption key —> ciphertext ////  two important parts of it (cipher and key)
            - Authentication/Authorization: checking if the user is the owner of the data
2. **Integrity**
    - **Data Integrity**: Ensures information is modified only in authorized ways. (trustworthiness of data)
        - integrity protection mechanisms:
            1. preventive: securing the data 
            2. Detective: every message has a Hash code if it changes then the message has been modified
3. **Availability**
    - Ensures systems are accessible to authorized users when needed.
    - can be attacked through:
        1. DOS(Denial of Service): the user sends so many requests that the utilization of the server can’t handle
        2. DDOS(Distributed Denial of Service): sending these requests from many devices 
4. **Accountability**
    - Ensures actions are traceable to responsible parties.
5. Non-Repudiation: protection against denial by one of the entities of a behavior (uses digital signature)

### **Impact Levels of Security Breach**

- **Low**: Minor effects on operations or assets (e.g., slight financial loss).
- **Moderate**: Serious effects on operations or assets (e.g., significant financial loss).
- **High**: Severe effects, potentially catastrophic (e.g., loss of life).

- **Security Attack**: Any action compromising organizational information security.
- **Security Mechanism**: Processes or devices to detect, prevent, or recover from attacks.
- **Security Service**: Enhances security in data processing, using mechanisms to counter attacks.

---

| **Threat** | A potential cause of an unwanted incident that may compromise system security. Examples: natural disasters, hackers. |
| --- | --- |
| **Attack** | An actual attempt to exploit a vulnerability in a system, aiming to cause harm. Examples: phishing, malware installation. |

- A *passive attack* attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources
    - Two types of passive attacks are:
        - The release of message contents
        - Traffic analysis
- An *active attack* attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation

### Attack Surface Categories

- **Network attack surface**
    
    Refers to vulnerabilities over an enterprise network, wide-area network, or the Internet
    
- **Software attack surface**
    
    Refers to vulnerabilities in application, utility, or operating system code
    
- **Human attack surface**
    
    Refers to vulnerabilities created by personnel or outsiders
