this is file1: 
this is file1: - Protection of automated information systems to maintain:
this is file1:     - **Confidentiality**
this is file1:     - **Integrity**
this is file1:     - **Availability**

this is file1: ### **CIA Triad**
this is file1: 
this is file1: 1. **Confidentiality**
this is file1:     - Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access.
this is file1:         - **Privacy**: Controls who can collect and share personal information.
this is file1:         - it’s done through:
this is file1:             - cryptography: computer —> Encryption key —> ciphertext ////  two important parts of it (cipher and key)
this is file1:             - Authentication/Authorization: checking if the user is the owner of the data
this is file1: 2. **Integrity**
this is file1:     - **Data Integrity**: Ensures information is modified only in authorized ways. (trustworthiness of data)
this is file1:         - integrity protection mechanisms:
this is file1:             1. preventive: securing the data 
this is file1:             2. Detective: every message has a Hash code if it changes then the message has been modified
this is file1: 3. **Availability**
this is file1:     - Ensures systems are accessible to authorized users when needed.
this is file1:     - can be attacked through:
this is file1:         1. DOS(Denial of Service): the user sends so many requests that the utilization of the server can’t handle
this is file1:         2. DDOS(Distributed Denial of Service): sending these requests from many devices 
this is file1: 4. **Accountability**
this is file1:     - Ensures actions are traceable to responsible parties.
this is file1: 5. Non-Repudiation: protection against denial by one of the entities of a behavior (uses digital signature)

this is file1: ### **Impact Levels of Security Breach**
this is file1: 
this is file1: - **Low**: Minor effects on operations or assets (e.g., slight financial loss).
this is file1: - **Moderate**: Serious effects on operations or assets (e.g., significant financial loss).
this is file1: - **High**: Severe effects, potentially catastrophic (e.g., loss of life).
