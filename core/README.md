ðŸ’» Core Projects
After completing the Piscine, students enter the Core phase, which consists of the Common Core curriculum. This curriculum is built around projects that cover different languages, concepts, and disciplines. It includes a range of projects, such as:

Algorithm Design: Projects like libft, get_next_line, and push_swap help develop strong problem-solving and algorithm skills.
System Programming: Projects like minitalk, so_long, and philosophers dive deep into low-level programming, focusing on processes, threads, memory management, and inter-process communication.
Advanced Topics: More challenging projects such as cub3d, webserv, and minishell allow students to explore advanced topics like multithreading, network programming, and web development.
The Common Core curriculum is designed to ensure that every student becomes a well-rounded software developer, equipped with the skills needed to build real-world applications.

- # [libft](https://github.com/samiaamer/42projects/tree/ab7a5c56509d4157e3f43e82211aa38688fdde8b/core/libft) - Libft

  -**What it is**: libft is about creating your own library of useful functions in C, like string manipulation, memory management, and more. You build these functions from scratch to better understand how things work behind the scenes.
  
    -**What I learned**: How to manage memory, work with pointers, and create essential functions like malloc, free, and basic string operations.
  
  - **Grade**: 100 / 100

- # [ft_printf](https://github.com/samiaamer/42projects/tree/54cb7142ca96adb415d12332c3520b51099bcecb/core/printf) - ft_printf

   -**What it is**: ft_printf is about re-creating the printf function that formats and prints data in different ways. You have to make sure it works with different types of data like strings, integers, and floats.

  -**What I learned**: How to handle multiple types of data using variadic functions and format them properly in the output.

  - **Grade**: 100 / 100

- # born2beroot

   -**What it is**: born2beroot involves setting up a Linux virtual machine using a script. It automates the installation and configuration of a Linux system, so itâ€™s ready for programming.

   -**What I learned**: How Linux works, how to set up a system from scratch, and how to use shell scripts to automate tasks.

- # [get_next_line](https://github.com/samiaamer/42projects/tree/1c8cff8c5ae42a6b4ac0670e461f2ddd53035211/core/GNL) - get_next_line

  -**What it is**: In this project, I created a function that reads a line of text from a file, no matter how big the file is. Itâ€™s all about handling files, buffers, and memory carefully.

   -**What I learned**: How to handle file input, manage memory efficiently, and use buffers to read data in chunks.
